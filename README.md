# HANGMANx
Importing the random and time modules.
    import random
    import time
    
Defining functions with specific global arguments.
 main function:
    global count
    global display
    global word
    global already_guessed
    global length
    global play_game
    words_to_guess
    
Implementing loops to execute the program.
    Play_loop: This function takes in the argument of play_game.
    Play_game: We use this argument to either continue the game after it is played once or end it according to what the user suggests.
    
Passing the function in the program to run.
    we call all the arguments again under the hangman() function.
We used the popular time and random modules to render our program. Executing different functions and using loops helped us with a better understanding of python basics.
